# Predicting the Oscars
A project completed for an Informatics class at the University of Washington

Are there measurable differences in the ways in which humans and models weigh the predictive value of the same feature set? What are the limitations of a model’s or a human’s ability to predict? To test these questions we focused our research on examining prediction in a constrained sample space: selecting the winner from the set of nominees for each years’ Best Picture Oscar at the Academy Awards. We looked at how human survey respondents, along with selected regressions/models, ranked the predictive power each feature from the same set. Furthermore, to test the limits of machine learning prediction in this area we utilized complex neural networks to predict the winner of the Best Picture award. We found that some differences exist between these classes of predictive agents, and that artificial neural networks do have strong potential for high efficacy when predicting events like the Academy Awards.
